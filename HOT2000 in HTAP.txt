HOT2000 in HTAP Design Considerations
-------------------------------------
Each HOT2000 v11 House File contains the following XML contents (ext .h2k):
  - House model data under tag <HouseFile><House>. The following subordinate tags are 
    available: <Specifications>, <WindowTightness>, <Temperatures>, <Baseloads>,
	<Generation>, <NaturalAirInfiltration>, <Ventilation>, <Components>. The Components 
	tag contains all envelope data for multiple surfaces.
  - Weather file name is specified under <ProgramInformation><Weather><library>
    (e.g., "Wth110.dir"). The weather directory (dir) file is NOT XML -- it is an ASCII
	file that contains a list of all region and city names.  The associated ".dat" file is
	also NOT XML and contains the design and bin data for all locations listed in the .dir
	file. The weather <Region> and <Location> (i.e., city) are also specified in this
	section.
  - Envelope code data for only those codes used reference in the house model are specified
    under tag <HouseFile><Codes>. The envelope code is specified in the section
	<House><Components> and multiple envelope components each contain a section. For example,
	if there are two ceiling components, there will be two <Ceiling> tags, each containing
	a reference to detailed data in the <Codes> section. Note that "User Specified" codes is 
	an exception to this since all that is required is the effective R-value.
  - Fuel cost data (rates) for all fuels used in the house are specified under the tag
    <HouseFile><FuelCosts>. Note that only one rate from the fuel cost library file
	(i.e., the "default") is specified in this section. 
  - Last run results under tag <HouseFile><AllResults>. This does NOT include an ERS number!
  
Each HOT2000 v11 Code Library file contains the following XML contents (ext .cod):
  - Envelope codes for Wall, Ceiling, CeilingFlat, Floor, Lintel, Window, BasementWall,
    CrawlspaceWall, and FloorHeader. Tags use these names under <Codes>.
  - Two types of codes in each section: <Favorite> or <UserDefined>
  - The code library file used by the "current invocation" of HOT2000 is referenced in the
    HOT2000.ini file, which is an ASCII file residing in the main HOT2000 folder. It
	contains a line that provides this reference. 
	e.g.: CODELIB_FILE=C:\HOT2000_v11_71\StdLibs\codeLib.cod
	Note that there is NO reference to the code library file name in the house data file!
	
Each Fuel Cost Library file contains he following XML contents (ext .flc):
  - Rate structure tags for an unlimited number of fuels of the following types 
   (tag names): <Electricity>, <NaturalGas>, <Oil>, <Propane>, <Wood>.
  - Each rate has a unit specifier, a single annual minimum rate charge, and up to four 
    block charges. There are no TOU specifications for electricity.
  - The fuel cost library file used by the "current invocation" of HOT2000 is referenced 
    in the HOT2000.ini file, which is an ASCII file residing in the main HOT2000 folder. It
	contains a line that provides this reference. 
	e.g.: FUELCOST_FILE=C:\HOT2000_v11_71\StdLibs\fuelLib.flc
	Note that the fuel cost library file name IS ALSO specified in the house data section
	<HouseFile><FuelCosts><library>.
