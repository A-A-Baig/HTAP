TRAINING NOTES:

1) Genopt-Optimization run
==========================

*** commands: 

cd C:\HTAP\applications\training\batch-run
java -cp 'C:\Program Files\genopt\genopt.jar' genopt.GenOpt Genopt-H2K-INI.GO-ini

C:\HTAP\recover-results.rb -l

a) Open up the .cmd file. Look at contents

    [ - Note that each parameter has a longer list, and more 
        parameters will be explored. 
           


b) Run command. Talk about what is happening. 

    [ Genopt is processing the batch run just as before. But because 
      it has to explore more combinations across more parameters 
      - 950,400 ! - the set will take much longer to complete. 
      this clearly isn't a workable solution. 
      
    
    ]

b) Stop the command, and intorduce 'optimization'

    [ - Examine the 'algorithm' section in the cmd file. Talk about how PSOIW 
        optimizaiton works.

      - Comment out mesh algorithm, and replace with PSOIW     
        
    ]
       
c) Re-Run command. Talk about what is happening. 

    [ Genopt is now using the PSOIW algorithm to find optimal points - 
      that is, points that minimize the search criteria.
      
      The search criteria are defined in the genopt INO file - 

        
d) Convert output to .csv format

   [ run C:\HTAP\recover-results.rb -l 
   
     open up cloud-results-all-data.csv in excel. 
   
e) Add some parameters to the cmd file batch  - 

    [ Add ACH_1_0 to the ACH (air-tightness results). Re-run 
      and note how the number of evaluations goes up from 27 to 36.
 
      
      

    ]

    
f) Demonstrate what happens if there is a miss-spelling in parameter
   definitions.

    [ Set ACH -> APH_1_0
         
          
    ]
    
   
    
    
g) Demonstrate a typical error - misspell Calggary
