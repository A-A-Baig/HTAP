TRAINING NOTES:

1) Genopt-Optimization run
==========================

*** commands: 

cd C:\HTAP\applications\training\batch-run
java -cp 'C:\Program Files\genopt\genopt.jar' genopt.GenOpt Genopt-H2K-INI.GO-ini

C:\HTAP\recover-results.rb -l

a) Open up the .cmd file. Look at contents

    [ - Note that each parameter has a longer list, and more 
        parameters will be explored. 
           


b) Run command. Talk about what is happening. 

    [ Genopt is processing the batch run just as before. But because 
      it has to explore more combinations across more parameters 
      - 950,400 ! - the set will take much longer to complete. 
      this clearly isn't a workable solution. 
      
    
    ]

b) Stop the command, and intorduce 'optimization'

    [ - Examine the 'algorithm' section in the cmd file. Talk about how PSOIW 
        optimizaiton works.

      - Comment out mesh algorithm, and replace with PSOIW     
        
    ]
       
c) Re-Run command. Talk about what is happening. 

    [ Genopt is now using the PSOIW algorithm to find optimal points - 
      that is, points that minimize the search criteria.
      
      The search criteria are defined in the genopt INI file - 
      the first of the objective functions listed in the 
      ObjectiveFunctionLocation section. The first one is optimized; 
      the others are recorded for reporting purposes only.
      
      Note that the objective function can be changed to any 
      other data recoreded in the substiture-pl-output.txt file. 
      


      You can also define your own output by adapting substiture-h2k.rb.

      
d) Stop command with Control-C. Point out that output-to-date is preserved.
  
    [ Talk about how you know when an optimization is complete. 
    
      Talk about GenOpt optimization efficiency

      
e) Convert output to .csv format

   [ run C:\HTAP\recover-results.rb -l 
   
     open up cloud-results-all-data.csv in excel. 
     
     note - Number of runs and number of results often do not match up. 
     We believe this is because the PSOIW algorithm sometimes -re-runs #s/
   
e) Open up example file from results. 

    [ Examine contents - and use colours to illustrate attribution.
