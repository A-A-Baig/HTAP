TRAINING NOTES:

1) How to customize HTAP. 
======================

*** commands: 

cd C:\HTAP\applications\training\single-cmd-line-run
C:\HTAP\substitute-h2k.rb -c .\HOT2000.choices -o .\HOT2000.options  -v


a) Define a new archetype - 

    [ Navigate to C:\HTAP\applications\training\single-cmd-line-run\Customize
  
      Open up HOT2000 v 11.3. and load the h2k-file/

      Fix ACH - set to blower door 

      Fix climate - set to ottawa

      Save to C:\HTAP\Archetypes as Custom-archetype.h2k

      run command  C:\HTAP\Archetypes> .\CopyToH2K.rb to copy to the h2k directory. 

      edit HOT2000.options file to point to new archetype  (Opt-Archetype)

      update .choice file and re-run
    
    ]

b) Add an air-change specification

    [ - Search for Opt-ACH 

      - Add a new option: ACH_2_0

      - Update choices and re-run. 

      - Note: ELA assumed to be calculated. 
        
    ]
       
c) Add a new window spec. 


    [ - Open up HOT2000, navigate to preferences, Libraries, click on code library

      - Select change, and navigate to HTAP/archetypes/codeLib.cod

      - Click on windows icon, and choose 'user-defined codes' 

      - Pick Overall window characteristics 

      - Give window a name (UltraHG)

      - Set SHGC/U/other parameters

      - Edit options file to crate new option

      - Set choice file to point to new window 

      - Rerun COpy C:\HTAP\Archetypes> .\CopyToH2K.rb

      - Run command substiture-rb.h2k


d) Add a new heating system: 
 
    [ - search out opt-HVACsystem, and comment on poor choice of name! 

      - Talk about the different tags that appear here - 
            - ESP-r artifacts. 
            - H2k type 1/2
            - H2k P9 definitions 

       - Note that not all systems require all definitions to be included. 


       CREATE a condensing furnace with 98 AFUE: 

       - Copy gas furnace ECM. Update 
            Tag 8: AirConditioning  (type2 definition)
            Tag 10: 5  (type: Condensing)
            Tag 11: 2  (capacity - calculated)
            Tag 12: NA (capacity - not needed)
            Tag 14: 98 (efficiency)

       
       - Limits: AC performance cannot currently be spec'd for conventional
         AC systess


       CREATE a heat pump with a -15°C cut-out temp AFUE: 

       - Copy gas furnace ECM. Update 
            Tag 8: AirConditioning  (type2 definition)
            Tag 10: 5  (type: Condensing)
            Tag 11: 2  (capacity - calculated)
            Tag 12: NA (capacity - not needed)
            Tag 14: 98 (efficiency)

       
       - Limits: AC performance cannot currently be spec'd for conventional
         AC systess

       - Mention: cooling specification doesn't work (has to be defined in HVAC


e) Other comments & Stuff that doesn't work: 
       - Electric loads / Hot water loads.
