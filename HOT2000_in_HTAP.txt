HOT2000 in HTAP Design Considerations
-------------------------------------
Each HOT2000 v11 House File contains the following XML contents (ext .h2k):
  - House model data under tag <HouseFile><House>. The following subordinate tags are 
    available: <Specifications>, <WindowTightness>, <Temperatures>, <Baseloads>,
	<Generation>, <NaturalAirInfiltration>, <Ventilation>, <Components>. The Components tag contains all envelope data for multiple surfaces.
  - Weather file name is specified under <ProgramInformation><Weather><library>
    (e.g., "Wth110.dir"). The weather directory (dir) file is NOT XML -- it is an ASCII
	file that contains a list of all region and city names.  The associated ".dat" file is
	also NOT XML and contains the design and bin data for all locations listed in the .dir
	file. The weather <Region> and <Location> (i.e., city) are also specified in this
	section.
  - Envelope code data for only those codes used reference in the house model are specified
    under tag <HouseFile><Codes>. The envelope code is specified in the section
	<House><Components> and multiple envelope components each contain a section. For example,
	if there are two ceiling components, there will be two <Ceiling> tags, each containing
	a reference to detailed data in the <Codes> section. Note that "User Specified" codes is an exception to this since all that is required is the effective R-value.
  - Fuel cost data (rates) for all fuels used in the house are specified under the tag
    <HouseFile><FuelCosts>. Note that only one rate from the fuel cost library file
	(i.e., the "default") is specified in this section. 
  - Last run results under tag <HouseFile><AllResults>. This does NOT include an ERS number!
  
Each HOT2000 v11 Code Library file contains the following XML contents (ext .cod):
  - Envelope codes for Wall, Ceiling, CeilingFlat, Floor, Lintel, Window, BasementWall,
    CrawlspaceWall, and FloorHeader. Tags use these names under <Codes>.
  - Two types of codes in each section: <Favorite> or <UserDefined>
  - The code library file used by the "current invocation" of HOT2000 is referenced in the
    HOT2000.ini file, which is an ASCII file residing in the main HOT2000 folder. It
	contains a line that provides this reference. 
	e.g.: CODELIB_FILE=C:\HOT2000_v11_71\StdLibs\codeLib.cod
	Note that there is NO reference to the code library file name in the house data file!
	
Each Fuel Cost Library file contains he following XML contents (ext .flc):
  - Rate structure tags for an unlimited number of fuels of the following types 
   (tag names): <Electricity>, <NaturalGas>, <Oil>, <Propane>, <Wood>.
  - Each rate has a unit specifier, a single annual minimum rate charge, and up to four 
    block charges. There are no TOU specifications for electricity.
  - The fuel cost library file used by the "current invocation" of HOT2000 is referenced 
    in the HOT2000.ini file, which is an ASCII file residing in the main HOT2000 folder. It
	contains a line that provides this reference. 
	e.g.: FUELCOST_FILE=C:\HOT2000_v11_71\StdLibs\fuelLib.flc
	Note that the fuel cost library file name IS ALSO specified in the house data section
	<HouseFile><FuelCosts><library>.

Options used for ESP-r HTAP --> Mapping to H2K:
===============================================
General Options
---------------
Opt-DBFiles --> Code library file name
	This can be any valid H2K v11 code library file name.
	
GOconfig_rotate --> Change orientation of wall/windows
	House rotation: Will only work if each wall orientation is entered in H2K model.
					Note that "Front Orientation" has no effect on calculations in H2K.
	
Opt-Location --> Weather region & location
	<HouseFile><ProgramInformation><Weather><Region> att:code, <English> value=name
	<HouseFile><ProgramInformation><Weather><Location> att:code, <English> value=name

Opt-Attachment --> Set detached, semi-detached or row house.
	<HouseFile><House><Specifications><HouseType> att:code, <English> value=name

Opt-ACH --> Change ACH@50 value
	<HouseFile><House><NaturalAirInfiltration><Specifications><BlowerTest> att:airChangeRate

Envelope Options
----------------
Opt-MainWall --> Change wall insulation
Method 1) Use Specified R-value for ALL walls
	<HouseFile><House><Components>
	For each wall
		..<Wall><Construction><Type> att:rValue  [always SI]

Method 2) Wall Code (Standard)
	<HouseFile><House><Components>
	For each wall
		..<Wall><Construction><Type> att:idref, tag value="10 alphaNum code"
		idref must appear in <Codes> section with full layered description!
		<Codes><Wall><Standard><Code> att:id=idref, tag value="10 alphaNum code"...
		<Codes><Wall><Standard><Code><Layers> ... Must be filled - Use code lookups!

Method 3) Wall Code (Favorite -- US spelling!)
	<HouseFile><House><Components>
	For each wall
		..<Wall><Construction><Type> att:idref, tag value="10 alphaNum code"
		idref must appear in <Codes> section with full layered description!
		<Codes><Wall><Favorite><Code> att:id=idref, tag value="10 alphaNum code"...
		<Codes><Wall><Favorite><Code><Layers> ... Must be filled - Copy from Library!

Method 4) Wall Code (User Defined)
	<HouseFile><House><Components>
	For each wall
		..<Wall><Construction><Type> att:idref, tag value="Name of code"
		idref must appear in <Codes> section with full layered description!
		<Codes><Wall><UserDefined><Code> att:id=idref, <Label>tag value="Name of code"...
		<Codes><Wall><UserDefined><Code><Layers> ... Must be filled -- copy from Library!
		
Opt-FloorSurface --> 

Opt-Ceilings --> 

Opt-BasementSlabInsulation --> 

Opt-BasementWallInsulation --> 

Opt-CasementWindows --> 

Opt-OverhangWidth --> Overhang dimension for all windows
	<HouseFile><House><Components>
	For each wall
		..<Wall><Components><Window><Measurements> att:overhangWidth

Opt-ExposedFloor --> 

Opt-RoofPitch -->

Opt-ElecLoadScale --> 

Opt-DHWLoadScale -->

Options not required in H2K
---------------------------
Opt-calcmode --> N/A
	Setting ending day & month + disabling shading

OPT-HRV_ctl --> N/A
	H2K using old ERS method of HRV operation. Could use v11 method by renaming
	Set_EGH.H2k file.
	
Opt-CTL-Strategy --> N/A
	No longer used!
	
OPT-OPR-SCHED --> N/A
	Defines an operations schedule for zoned systems. Need hourly inputs to do this in H2K.
	
Opt-BaseWindows --> N/A
	Not required!

Opt-geometry --> N/A
	Used for defining simple ESP-r geometries. This is unnecessary for H2K.

Opt-AirTightness --> Specified individual .aim files in ESP-r
	-> Redundant option for H2K!
	
Opt-WindowOrientation --> N/A
	Used for ESP-r only.
	
Opt-GenericWall_2Layer_definitions --> N/A for HOT2000

Opt-ExtraDrywall --> N/A for HOT2000 (thermal mass insensitive)
