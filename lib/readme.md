# HTAP Libraries

This directory contains HOT2000 code and fuel libraries. The script `CopyToH2K.rb` will automatically copy them to the right location. Run the script as follows:

```powershell
C:\HTAP\lib> ruby .\CopyToH2K.rb
```

(All relevant files will be copied into C:\H2K-CLI-Min\User and C:\H2K-CLI-Min\StdLibs )
